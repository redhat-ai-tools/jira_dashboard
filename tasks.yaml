  epic_analysis_task:
    description: |
      Analyze the following epic summaries to identify which epics show significant changes,

      Epic Summaries Content:
      {epic_content}
      
      Your analysis should:
      
       1. FILTER: Identify which epics have significant progress, changes, or developments
          (not just routine updates). Look for:
          - Major features completed or significant milestones reached
          - Important technical breakthroughs or solutions implemented
          - Critical issues resolved or major blockers removed
          - New capabilities delivered or architectural improvements
          - Significant progress toward business objectives
          - **IMPORTANT: Always include epics that mention being resolved, completed, or finished - these are significant achievements**
      
      2. ACHIEVEMENTS: For the significant epics, summarize the key achievements:
          - What major work was completed?
          - What business value was delivered?
          - What technical capabilities were added?
          - What problems were solved?
      
      3. NEXT STEPS: Identify what needs to be done next:
          - What are the immediate priorities?
          - What blockers need to be addressed?
          - What dependencies need to be resolved?
          - What resources or decisions are needed?
      
                       Structure your response clearly with sections for:
       - EPICS WITH SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS (list the epic keys and brief reason)
       - KEY ACHIEVEMENTS SUMMARY
       - PRIORITY NEXT STEPS
       
       CRITICAL: Do NOT filter out epics that mention being resolved, completed, or finished.
       These represent important achievements that leadership needs to see.
       
       Focus on insights that would help leadership understand progress and make decisions.
       Be concise but comprehensive.
